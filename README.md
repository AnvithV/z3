## Z3 + Phaser (Vite)

Browser demo showing Z3 constraints alongside a Phaser scene. Built with Vite + vanilla JS.

### Setup
```
cd /Users/anvith/z3/web-z3-phaser
npm install
```

### Run dev server
```
npm run dev
```
Open the printed localhost URL. The page solves:
- Children/pets puzzle
- Fence constraints (inside/on/outside)
- Finite-range value sampling via model blocking
and displays a minimal Phaser scene placeholder.

### Build preview
```
npm run build
npm run preview
```
